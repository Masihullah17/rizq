Zomato, rebranded as Eternal, stands as one of India’s foremost food technology platforms, operating across multiple segments including food delivery, quick commerce via its Blinkit unit, B2B supplies through Hyperpure, and live events under District. The company’s core food delivery business remains its primary revenue engine, supported by a vast network of over 2.47 lakh restaurant partners and millions of active users. Over the past few years, Zomato has transitioned from a loss-making startup to achieving profitability in its food delivery operations by optimizing platform fees and driving higher average order values. In contrast, Blinkit—acquired in mid-2022—has experienced remarkable revenue growth, with its gross order value more than doubling; however, it continues to incur losses as the company aggressively invests in expanding its network of dark stores and warehouses, which has put upward pressure on overall expenses.

Recent quarterly results underscored this dual narrative, with consolidated revenue from operations rising by approximately 64% year-on-year to over ₹5,400 crore, while net profit declined by 57% compared to the previous quarter due to soaring logistics, marketing, and expansion costs. This dynamic reflects Zomato’s current strategy of rapid scaling amid competitive intensity, a move that has delivered strong top-line growth yet challenged short-term margins. The firm benefits from strong brand recognition, advanced technology integration—including personalized recommendation algorithms—and a robust logistics network, all of which underpin its dominant market share in food delivery. Nevertheless, high operational costs, dependency on third-party restaurant partners, and mounting regulatory scrutiny over practices like aggressive discounting present notable weaknesses that continue to temper investor sentiment.

Looking forward, Zomato’s growth prospects remain optimistic. The company projects an annual growth rate of around 30% in its food delivery segment over the next five years, buoyed by rising digital adoption and expanding urban consumer demand. Its ongoing investments in enhancing the Blinkit network and refining its delivery operations are expected to gradually improve margins, although the competitive landscape—fierce rivalry from Swiggy and emerging players such as Zepto—poses a significant risk to achieving sustainable profitability. Moreover, the rapid expansion in the quick commerce arena, while promising in the long term, continues to challenge short-term financial discipline. Overall, despite recent stock volatility and near-term profit pressures, Zomato’s strategic initiatives, market leadership, and innovative technological capabilities provide a solid foundation for long-term value creation. Investors should closely monitor the company’s execution on scaling its quick commerce operations and managing cost pressures, as these will be critical determinants of future performance. citeturn0news49
