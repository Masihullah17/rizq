ITC Limited operates as a diversified conglomerate with leading positions in cigarettes, fast‐moving consumer goods (FCCG), hotels, paperboards and packaging, and agribusiness. Its cigarette business remains the largest contributor to revenues and profits, benefiting from strong pricing power, high margins and an extensive distribution network. Over the past few years, the company has steadily grown its non‐tobacco FMCG portfolio—spanning branded staples such as biscuits, snacks, dairy and personal care—although these newer businesses still contribute less than 20 percent of total sales. The paperboards and packaging division leverages synergies with its agri sourcing operations, supplying both internal and external customers, while its hotels segment is rebounding from pandemic lows.

In the latest fiscal year, ITC reported consolidated revenues of approximately ₹75,000 crore, up low‐double digits year‑on‑year, and net profit of around ₹20,000 crore, driven by healthy volume growth in cigarettes and margin expansion in FMCG. Operating cash flow remains robust, supporting a dividend payout ratio north of 70 percent. The balance sheet is strong, with net debt effectively zero and ample liquidity to fund capex and acquisitions.

ITC’s strengths include its dominant cigarette franchise—where it holds over 80 percent market share—an entrenched rural and urban distribution network, and a track record of generating high free cash flow. Its strong brand equity and scale advantage in paperboards and FMCG provide barriers to entry for competitors. However, the company’s heavy reliance on tobacco exposes it to regulatory and excise‐tax risks. Non‐tobacco FMCG businesses, while growing rapidly, remain unprofitable at the EBITDA level and require continued investment to achieve scale. The hotel business is cyclical and sensitive to economic downturns.

Looking ahead, ITC’s growth prospects hinge on accelerating the profitability of its FMCG portfolio through deeper penetration in rural markets, digital and e‐commerce channels, and leveraging data analytics for consumer insights. The paperboards division is poised to benefit from packaging demand driven by e‐tailing and organized retail. Potential acquisitions in fast‐growing consumer categories could provide strategic growth, although valuation discipline will be critical. Key risks include heightened regulatory scrutiny on tobacco, commodity‐price inflation pressuring margins, and execution challenges in scaling newer businesses.

On balance, ITC offers a defensive investment profile with stable cash flows, an attractive dividend yield of around 7 percent, and a diversified portfolio that is gradually de‐risking away from tobacco. While near‐term earnings growth may be modest, the company’s capital allocation discipline, strong brands and distribution moat underpin a favorable long‐term outlook for patient investors.
