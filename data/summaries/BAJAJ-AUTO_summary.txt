Bajaj Auto is India’s leading two‑ and three‑wheeler manufacturer, with strong market shares across motorcycles (notably in the 125 cc+ segment) and ICE three‑wheelers, where it commands nearly 78 percent share. Its product portfolio spans premium motorcycles under Pulsar and Dominar, mass‑market bikes, three‑wheelers, and a growing electric vehicle line including the Chetak scooter and e‑rickshaws across 60 cities. The company leverages a low‑cost manufacturing base in Pune and Chakan, a robust dealer network exceeding 6,000 outlets, and technical collaborations (notably with KTM) to maintain technological leadership and margin resilience.  

In Q4 FY24, consolidated revenue rose about 30 percent YoY to ₹11,915 crore while net profit climbed 18 percent to ₹2,011 crore, driven by strong domestic volumes, exports and spares sales; FY24 revenue and profit grew 23 percent and 27 percent respectively, with EBITDA margins improving by 80 bps to over 20 percent citeturn0search3turn0search9. Q3 FY25 saw more modest growth—revenue up ~8 percent and profit up 3.3 percent YoY—as global cost pressures and product mix moderated near‑term gains citeturn0search7turn0news10. The balance sheet remains strong, with net cash of over ₹8,000 crore and return on equity north of 25 percent.  

Key strengths include dominant market positions, a diversified business spanning vehicles and high‑margin spares, prudent capital allocation with ~₹80/share dividend payout, and early leadership in electric three‑wheelers and scooters. Bajaj’s lean cost structure and strong cash flows support ongoing R&D and international expansion, with exports expected to grow 20 percent over the coming months, led by Latin America and Southeast Asia citeturn0news10. Weaknesses lie in reliance on ICE products amid accelerating EV transition, exposure to commodity cost swings (steel, aluminum), and intensifying competition from TVS, Hero MotoCorp and new EV entrants.  

Growth prospects hinge on scaling EV offerings, expanding spares aftermarket, deeper penetration in Latin American and African markets, and leveraging KTM tie‑ups. Risks include regulatory shifts (emission norms, EV incentives), currency volatility affecting exports, and potential demand slowdowns if rural income growth falters.  

Overall, Bajaj Auto offers a balanced investment proposition: a defensible franchise with high cash returns and dividend yield (~3 percent), moderate growth driven by EV and exports, and resilient margins. Valuations trade at a slight premium to peers (PE ~20x FY25), justified by superior return ratios but leaving limited margin for error if execution or macro conditions deteriorate.
